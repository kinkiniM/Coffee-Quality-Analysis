# Coffee-Quality-Analysis

Project Overview
The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) works to improve the quality and value of coffee worldwide through research, training, and certification. This project aims to analyze a rich dataset provided by CQI, which includes sensory evaluations, production details, and defect information. By exploring these factors, we aim to understand the determinants of coffee quality, identify correlations between various variables, and uncover insights that can help improve coffee standards globally.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage the CQI dataset to address the following key research questions:

Determinants of Coffee Quality: What are the key sensory attributes (e.g., aroma, flavor, acidity) that contribute to coffee quality scores?
Processing Methods and Origins: Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?
Impact of Defects: Can we identify trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?
Interrelationships Between Variables: How do different variables interact to influence the Total Cup Points, a measure of overall coffee quality?
Data
The dataset includes information on coffee production, processing, sensory evaluations, and defects. Key variables include:

Sensory Attributes:
Aroma: Evaluates the fragrance of the coffee.
Flavor: Includes notes of sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and overall taste profile.
Aftertaste: Refers to the taste that lingers after drinking.
Acidity: Describes the brightness or liveliness of the coffee.
Body: Refers to the thickness or viscosity of the coffee.
Balance: Evaluates how well the different flavor components work together.
Uniformity: Consistency of flavor across different cups of the same coffee.
Clean Cup: Refers to the absence of off-flavors or defects.
Sweetness: The caramel-like, fruity, or floral sweetness in the coffee.
Total Cup Points: A sum of the 10 sensory attributes, representing overall coffee quality.
Defects:
Category One Defects: Visible defects like black beans, sour beans, insect-damaged beans, etc.
Category Two Defects: Subtle defects detected through tasting, such as over-fermentation, staleness, or chemical taste.
Other Variables:
Processing Methods: How the coffee beans were processed, such as washed or natural.
Origin Region: The geographical location where the coffee was grown, which may affect its quality due to soil and climate conditions.
Tools and Technologies
Microsoft Excel: For quick data inspection, analysis, and basic visualizations.
MicroSoft PowerBi : For Data Visualization And Report
Key Questions Addressed
What are the key sensory attributes that contribute to higher coffee quality scores?
Is there a relationship between specific processing methods or coffee origins and the overall coffee quality (Total Cup Points)?
How do Category One and Category Two defects impact the Total Cup Points?
What patterns can be identified in coffee defects and their effects on quality?
Can What-If analysis uncover potential scenarios to improve coffee quality scores?
Project Outcomes
Determinants of Coffee Quality:
The analysis identified that aroma, flavor, and acidity are the top contributors to high Total Cup Points. Improving these sensory attributes can significantly enhance coffee quality.

Impact of Processing Methods and Origin Regions:
Coffee from certain regions, combined with specific processing methods (e.g., washed or natural), exhibited higher Total Cup Points. Understanding these correlations can help producers refine their methods.

Defects and Quality Impact:
Category One defects such as black beans and sour beans significantly lowered overall coffee quality scores, while Category Two defects had a less noticeable but still negative impact.

Interactive Analysis with What-If Scenarios:
Using What-If analysis, scenarios were explored to understand how different combinations of sensory attributes or defect reductions could lead to higher quality outcomes.

Insights and Recommendations
Focus on Aroma, Flavor, and Acidity: Producers should prioritize improving these key sensory attributes to maximize quality scores.
Processing Methods Matter: Tailoring processing techniques based on coffee origin can lead to better overall quality.
Defect Management: Reducing Category One defects such as black beans and sour beans could significantly boost coffee quality.
Future Work
Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict Total Cup Points based on sensory attributes and defects.
Advanced Visualizations: Develop interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau to present findings more effectively.
Expansion of Dataset: Include more variables such as climate data, soil conditions, and advanced genetic markers to further refine quality predictions.
